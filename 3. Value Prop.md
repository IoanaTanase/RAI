- Improves the accuracy and performance of AI models.

Example: A federal judge fined two lawyers $5,000 and dismissed their case after they used ChatGPT to cite fake legal cases in court filings.

Example 2: Importance of including citations: https://xapp.ai/ai-citations-rag/

- Reduces the risk of AI-related incidents and failures.

Example 1: A study reveals that teenagers are forming intense and sometimes unhealthy relationships with AI chatbots like Character.AI, while their parents remain largely unaware of the extent and nature of this usage. Source: https://futurism.com/the-byte/teens-relationships-ai
