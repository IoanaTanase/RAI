Microsoft Defender for Cloud's threat protection for AI workloads identifies threats to generative AI applications in real time and helps respond to security issues.

Defender for Cloud's AI threat protection works with Azure AI Content Safety Prompt Shields and Microsoft's threat intelligence to provide security alerts for threats like data leakage, data poisoning, jailbreak, and credential theft.

Defender XDR integration
Threat protection for AI workloads integrates with the Defender XDR, allowing security teams to centralize AI workload alerts in the Defender XDR portal.

Security teams can correlate AI workload alerts and incidents in the Defender XDR portal to understand the full scope of an attack, including malicious activities related to their generative AI applications.
