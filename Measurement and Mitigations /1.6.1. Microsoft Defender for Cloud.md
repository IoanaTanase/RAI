Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a cloud-native application protection platform (CNAPP) that includes security measures and practices designed to protect cloud-based applications from various cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Defender for Cloud includes:
- A development security operations (DevSecOps) solution that unifies security management at the code level across multicloud and multi-pipeline environments
- A cloud security posture management (CSPM) solution that identifies actions to prevent breaches
- A cloud workload protection platform (CWPP) with protections for servers, containers, storage, databases, and other workloads

The Microsoft 365 Defender portal helps security teams investigate attacks on cloud resources, devices, and identities. Microsoft 365 Defender provides an overview of attacks, including suspicious and malicious events in cloud environments. Microsoft 365 Defender achieves this by correlating all alerts and incidents, including cloud alerts and incidents.
## Overview - AI threat protection

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's threat protection for AI workloads identifies threats to generative AI applications in real time and helps respond to security issues.

Defender for Cloud's AI threat protection works with Azure AI Content Safety Prompt Shields and Microsoft's threat intelligence to provide security alerts for threats like data leakage, data poisoning, jailbreak, and credential theft.

Defender XDR integration
Threat protection for AI workloads integrates with the Defender XDR, allowing security teams to centralize AI workload alerts in the Defender XDR portal.

Security teams can correlate AI workload alerts and incidents in the Defender XDR portal to understand the full scope of an attack, including malicious activities related to their generative AI applications.
