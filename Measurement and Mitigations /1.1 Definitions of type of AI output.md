## Generative AI output definitions

In order to identify type of risks, and mitigations, in generative AI output, it's important to start with an understanding of common scenarions. The below provides an overview of the type of interactions and outputs that are commonly used. 

## Definitions for general audiences

- Content generation: The creation of original text, images, audio, or video based on prompts, often used for storytelling, marketing, or creative design.
- Multi-turn chat: A conversational AI interaction that maintains context across multiple exchanges, enabling more coherent and personalized dialogue.
- Single-turn chat: A one-off interaction where the AI responds to a single prompt without retaining context from previous exchanges.
- QA: Short for "Question Answering," this involves providing accurate, concise answers to user questions based on a given context or knowledge base.
- Rewrite: The transformation of existing text to improve clarity, tone, style, or structure while preserving the original meaning.
- Summarization: The process of condensing longer content into a shorter version that retains the key points and essential information.
- IP: In this context, typically refers to "Intellectual Property," involving the generation or management of content that may have legal ownership or copyright implications.
- Code generation: The automated creation of programming code from natural language descriptions or specifications, often used to accelerate software development.

## Definitions for technical audiences 

- Content generation: Produces original outputs such as text, images, or audio from input prompts using generative models.
- Multi-turn chat: Maintains conversational context across multiple user-AI exchanges to support coherent and stateful dialogue.
- Single-turn chat: Processes and responds to isolated prompts without retaining or referencing prior context.
- QA: Extracts or generates precise answers to user queries based on structured or unstructured data sources.
- Rewrite: Alters existing text to improve or modify tone, clarity, structure, or style while preserving semantic intent.
- Summarization: Reduces longer content into a concise version that retains key information and meaning.
- IP: Refers to the generation or handling of content with potential intellectual property implications, including originality, attribution, and copyright.
- Code generation: Translates natural language instructions into executable code across various programming languages and frameworks.
