# The Prompt Report: A Systematic Survey of Prompting Techniques

In this paper, the authors conduct a systematic literature review of all Generative AI (GenAI) prompting and prompt engineering techniques (prefix only). They combine human and machine efforts to process 4,797 records from arXiv, Semantic Scholar, and ACL, extracting 1,565 relevant papers through the PRISMA review process. From this dataset, they present 58 text-based techniques, complemented by an extensive collection of multimodal and multilingual techniques.
The authors' goal is to provide a robust directory of prompting techniques that can be easily understood and implemented. They also review agents as an extension of prompting, including methods for evaluating output and designing prompts that facilitate safety and security. Lastly, they apply prompting techniques in two case studies.

They present a comprehensive taxonomy of prompting techniques, methods for instructing Large Language Models (LLMs) to complete tasks. They divide prompting techniques into three categories: text-based, multilingual, and multimodal. Multilingual techniques are used to prompt LLMs in non-English settings. Multimodal techniques are used when working with non-textual modalities such as image and audio.
