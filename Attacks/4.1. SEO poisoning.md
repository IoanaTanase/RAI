# SEO poisoning 

SEO == Search engine optimization

SEO poisoning is a cybersecurity threat where attackers manipulate search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to promote malicious websites in search results. While SEO poisoning primarily targets search engines, it can also impact AI models that rely on web data for training or decision-making. Hereâ€™s an overview:

## What is SEO Poisoning?
SEO poisoning involves using deceptive SEO practices to ensure that malicious websites rank highly for popular search queries. When users click on these links, they may be redirected to phishing sites, exposed to malware, or tricked into revealing sensitive information 

## Techniques Used in SEO Poisoning
- Keyword Stuffing: Overloading webpages with excessive, often irrelevant keywords to manipulate search rankings 
- Link Farms: Creating networks of low-quality websites that link back to the malicious page, artificially inflating its number of backlinks 
- Cloaking: Serving different content to search engine crawlers and human visitors, displaying benign content to search engines while delivering malicious material to users
- Compromising legitimate websites: Sometimes legitimate websites are compromised to host additional content or fake sites are created to mimic trusted sources. The goal is to leverage the trust users place in high-ranking search results to direct them to specific pages.

## Another connected attacks 

Spamdexing manipulates search engine indexes using unethical means like keyword stuffing, hidden text, and doorway pages. It aims to inflate rankings and mislead users. Search engines fight this with algorithms, while webmasters are urged to follow ethical SEO practices to maintain trustworthy search results.

AI can now decipher keystrokes from keyboard sounds, posing privacy risks as sensitive data like passwords could be intercepted. Attackers use microphones to capture typing sounds and reconstruct text. Precautions such as ambient noise software, virtual keyboards, or biometric authentication can help mitigate this threat.

## Impact on AI Models
AI models that use web data for training or decision-making can be affected by SEO poisoning in several ways:
-  Data Integrity: Malicious websites can introduce biased or incorrect data into the training datasets, compromising the model's accuracy and reliability.
- Model Bias: If an AI model is trained on poisoned data, it may develop biases that lead to incorrect predictions or decisions.
- Security Risks: AI models that interact with poisoned websites may inadvertently expose sensitive information or become vectors for malware.

## Mitigation Strategies
To protect AI models from the effects of SEO poisoning, several strategies can be employed:
- Data Validation: Implementing rigorous checks to ensure the integrity and authenticity of web data used for training.
- Robust Training Methods: Using techniques that make models less sensitive to outliers and anomalies.
- Continuous Monitoring: Regularly evaluating model performance and data sources to detect and mitigate the impact of poisoned data.
