- The article titled "‘You Can’t Lick a Badger Twice’: Google Failures Highlight a Fundamental AI Flaw" by Brian Barrett discusses a peculiar issue with Google's AI Overviews feature. The feature is designed to provide explanations for phrases, but it has been found to generate credible-sounding explanations for completely made-up idioms. For instance, if you type any nonsensical phrase followed by the word "meaning" into Google, the AI will not only confirm that the gibberish is a real saying but also provide a detailed explanation of its supposed origin and meaning.This highlights a fundamental flaw in AI systems: their tendency to produce authoritative-sounding but entirely fabricated information. The article uses this example to illustrate broader concerns about the reliability and trustworthiness of AI-generated content. Source: https://www.wired.com/story/google-ai-overviews-meaning/
