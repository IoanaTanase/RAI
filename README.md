Hi, I am Ioana - I work on Responsible AI (or Trustworthy AI) and I spend most of my time screaming at (to be read instructing) AI to to what it's meant to do and to do it in a responsible, safe and fair way. 
This repro will help you 
- understand how to develop safety system messages (also known as metaprompts)
- provide safety system messages for different type of gen AI risks and harms (as well as lessons I learnt writing them at times)
- the random other things I will discover that I wish somebody told me when I started on this journey
